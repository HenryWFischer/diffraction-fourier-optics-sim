# diffraction-fourier-optics-sim
Diffraction & Fourier Optics Simulation is a Python-based project that models diffraction patterns produced by single-slit and double-slit apertures using Fraunhofer diffraction theory. The simulation demonstrates how spatial features of apertures translate into far-field intensity distributions, leveraging the mathematical framework of Fourier optics. By adjusting parameters such as slit width, slit separation, and wavelength, users can explore how interference and diffraction combine to shape the observed patterns.
